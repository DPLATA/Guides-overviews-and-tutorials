# Kubernetes (Minikube) tutorial for complete beginners 

This tutorial provides a step by step by guide for developing a simple web server (using Node js and express), containerizing it (using Docker) and deploying it to a kubernetes cluster (using Minukube).

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. I recommend you to follow along writing your own files but my sourcec code will
be uploaded in this repo so that you can check it out in case of any problem.

## Audience

This tutorial is prepared for those who want to understand what containerizing and deployment of applications using container orchestration is. This tutorial will help you understand the basic principles of
dockerizing an app plus kubernetes deployment basics.

## Prerequisites

This tutorial was built on a PC running Fedora 32 OS so Linux or MacOS environments will be better suited to follow along. You need no previous knowledge about neither Docker nor Kubernetes but their
installation is beyond the scope of this tutorial, so you should have already running on your PC Docker and Minikube. Also we'll be developing a simple express web server but it's explanation is also not covered
in this guide so you should have a basic understanding of web development, plus have installed Node js and npm. I'll try my best to explain concepts in depth ;).

## Introduction



### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running

Say what the step will be

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo

## Running the tests

Explain how to run the automated tests for this system

### Break down into end to end tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```

### And coding style tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```

## Deployment

Add additional notes about how to deploy this on a live system
